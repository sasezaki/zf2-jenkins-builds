## OUT OF DATE
This repository was experimental made for Jenkins CI.
Because several years ago zendframework/zf2 did not do CI. (Currently it uses Travis CI, and also probably Scrutinizer-ci will be introduced zendframework/zf2#5860 , so nowadays this repository would be useless.

##HOW TO USE?
### INSTALL 
phpunit, jenkins, ant &

ppw - PHP Project Wizard 
(when use zf2-jenkins-builds.php)

 - http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/908-PHP-Project-Wizard.html

### SETTING

    $mv builds/ /path/to/zf2/

> OR

    $sudo php zf2-jenkins-builds.php
